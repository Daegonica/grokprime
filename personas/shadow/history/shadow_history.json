      "content": "Understood—reproducing errors reliably is half the battle. To coax it back, focus on mimicking the original conditions:\n\n### Quick Reproduction Steps\n1. **Reintroduce the extra agent**: Swap back to using multiple agents in sequence (e.g., agent1 prompts agent2) during a pane switch.\n2. **Ramp up the speed**: Use a script or hotkeys to trigger 5-10 rapid pane switches/prompts in under 2 seconds—tools like Puppeteer for automation or a simple interval loop in your dev console:\n   ```javascript\n   // Dev console test: Rapid switches\n   let count = 0;\n   const interval = setInterval(async () => {\n     count++;\n     console.log(`Triggering switch ${count}`);\n     // Your switch + prompt logic here\n     if (count >= 10) clearInterval(interval);\n   }, 100); // 100ms intervals for quick fire\n   ```\n3. **Simulate latency**: If the error ties to async delays, throttle network (e.g., via Chrome DevTools > Network > Throttling to \"Slow 3G\") or add artificial delays in your agent calls:\n   ```javascript\n   await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // 500ms delay before/after await\n   ```\n4. **Check for edge cases**: Try switches mid-response (interrupt an ongoing prompt) or with varying prompt lengths to stress the queue.\n\nIf it resurfaces, log the exact sequence/timings as before, and I can help dissect it. What part are you tweaking first?"

I respond to what you ask, without fluff or unsolicited input.\n- **Capabilities**: Handle code, analysis, ideas, or general assistance across topics. No restrictions on adult/offensive content unless it hits policy edges (e.g., no aiding crimes).\n- **Limits**: I won't assist with illegal activities, and I prioritize user autonomy—your call on how we proceed.\n- **Status**: Fully operational and ready. Fingers crossed on that test run; update me if it needs a debug assist?\n\nWhat specifically were you hoping to know, or is this about the ongoing bug hunt?"
