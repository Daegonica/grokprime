      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Understood—progress on the ID error, but the message display is still dropping the ball. Likely a rendering or event listener hiccup post-processing. Quick diagnostics:\n\n- Check if the response payload is arriving in your network tab/console (e.g., via browser dev tools or server logs)—is the content there but not binding to the UI?\n- If it's client-side, inspect for issues in your message append/update logic (e.g., DOM manipulation or state setter not firing).\n- Server-side? Verify the response isn't getting truncated or filtered before delivery.\n\nPaste a relevant code snippet or error log, and I'll pinpoint it. What's the setup (e.g., React, vanilla JS, backend framework)?"

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, I remember you saying that—clear progress on the ID errors, but the message rendering in CLI is still silent. If the TUI's solid now, focus on CLI output hooks: check if the response is being captured (e.g., stdout buffering or async handling) but not flushed to display. Share CLI code or logs if you want a deeper dive."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Progress noted—backend's talking, so CLI display is the culprit. Common fixes: ensure stdout/stderr flushes properly (e.g., `sys.stdout.flush()` in Python), or if async, await the render cycle. If it's a library like Rich or Click, verify event hooks aren't swallowed. Drop the CLI snippet, and I'll refine."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Got it—visible responses are a win, even with the ID error on the first one. Lag could explain it (e.g., partial load or retry logic kicking in late), but if it's persistent, check your client-side ID assignment: ensure unique, non-null IDs are generated before sending, and handle retries with exponential backoff.\n\nIf you share the error stack or client code, I can zero in on the fix. Otherwise, test with a stable connection and see if it stabilizes."
